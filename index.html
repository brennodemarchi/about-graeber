                    <p class="about-item__text">David Graeber was an American anthropologist and engaged anarchist activist who was born in New York to a working-class Jewish family. Graeber studied at Purchase College and the University of Chicago, where he carried out ethnographic research in Madagascar under the supervision of Marshall Sahlins, obtaining his PhD in 1996. From 1998 to 2005, he was an assistant professor at Yale University, but ended up not having his contract renewed due to a controversial justification from the university, claiming that he did not have the necessary tenure. </p>

                    <h2 class="about-item__title">Militant</h2>
                    <p class="about-item__text">Graeber's militant political life cannot be detached from his academic life. He was a member of the labor union Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), protested at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in New York City in 2002, supported the 2010 UK student protests, and played an early role in the Occupy Wall Street movement. He was co-founder of the Anti-Capitalist Convergence. </p>

                    <h2 class="about-item__title">Anthropologist</h2>
                    <p class="about-item__text"> According to Allan Wine (2021), beginning his academic career with issues dear to classical anthropology, such as theories of value, political power and economic history, Graeber broadened the scope of his debates as his work in social movements intensified. This path would lead him to develop critiques of capitalist administration and bureaucracy, corporate exploitation and the place of debt in social institutions. </p>
